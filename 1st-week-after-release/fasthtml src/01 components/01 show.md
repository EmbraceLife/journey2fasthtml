Let's break down the `show` function you've shared:

```python
def show(ft, *rest):
    if rest: ft = (ft,) + rest
    return display.HTML(to_xml(ft))
```

### Purpose
The `show` function is designed to convert a FastHTML element or a collection of elements into an HTML string and display it using IPython's HTML display capabilities. This is useful for rendering HTML content directly in environments like Jupyter Notebooks.

### Inputs
- `ft`: This is a FastHTML element or a tuple representing an element tree that you want to convert to HTML.
- `*rest`: This allows for additional elements to be passed, which will be combined into a tuple with `ft`.

### High-Level Actions
1. **Check for Additional Elements**: 
   - The function checks if there are any additional elements passed via `*rest`.
   - If there are, it combines `ft` with these additional elements into a tuple. This makes it possible to handle multiple elements at once.

2. **Convert to XML**:
   - The function calls `to_xml(ft)` to convert the FastHTML elements into an XML string. The `to_xml` function processes the element tree and returns a string representation of the XML.   [[01 to_xml| dive into to_xml]]

3. **Display the HTML**:
   - The function then uses `display.HTML` to render the XML string as HTML in an environment that supports it, such as Jupyter Notebook.

### Big Picture Summary

The `show` function is a utility designed for use in interactive environments to easily convert and display FastHTML elements as HTML. By supporting multiple elements through its variadic arguments, it offers flexibility in rendering complex structures directly in the notebook interface. The function leverages FastHTML's XML conversion capabilities to seamlessly display the elements as web content.
