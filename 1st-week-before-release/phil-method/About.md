[site](https://about.fastht.ml/#sec1)

### part 1


You’re using a FastHTML app right now. We didn’t create a separate blog system for this site, because building apps with FastHTML is so easy there’s no need for it! Here is the [source code](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fh-about/blob/main/overview.py) for the page you’re reading right now. You’ll see that the source code is very simple, relying on Python components like `Markdown` to build the page. The components are simple Python functions—for instance, here is the [source code for `Markdown`](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fh-about/blob/main/app.py#L6), taking just one line of code! Out of the box FastHTML provides authentication, [database](https://about.fastht.ml/tech#sec5) access, styles (via [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/)), and more. Every part of the system is extensible and replacable using pip-installable Python modules.

**Jeremy**: Hey Julie, have you ever wondered what makes a web page work behind the scenes?

**Julie**: Yeah, I've always been curious. I know there’s some coding involved, but I don’t really understand how it all fits together.

**Jeremy**: Great! Let's start with the basics. You mentioned coding, which is spot on. Websites are built with code, and one of the tools we use in FastHTML is called Markdown. Have you heard of Markdown before?

**Julie**: I think so. Isn’t it like a simpler way to format text without using complicated HTML tags?

**Jeremy**: Exactly! Markdown is like a shorthand for writing HTML. Instead of writing out long HTML tags, you can use simpler symbols to format your text. For example, using `#` before a line makes it a header. It’s like using a key to quickly write in fancy fonts without needing to learn a new language.

**Julie**: Oh, that sounds helpful. So, FastHTML uses Markdown to build pages?

**Jeremy**: Yes, and it’s incredibly simple. In fact, the function to process Markdown in FastHTML is just one line of code. This makes it easy for us to transform plain text into well-structured HTML. Can you imagine why keeping things simple is beneficial?

**Julie**: I guess it saves time and makes things easier to understand and manage.

**Jeremy**: Exactly! Simplicity is powerful, especially in web development. FastHTML takes advantage of this by providing built-in tools and features. For example, it includes authentication, which is how we manage users logging in and out. Why do you think that’s important?

**Julie**: To keep the site secure, right? So only the right people can access certain parts?

**Jeremy**: Right again! Security is crucial. FastHTML also offers database access. Do you know what a database is?

**Julie**: I think it's where all the information is stored, like usernames and passwords, right?

**Jeremy**: That’s correct. A database is like a big, organized library where we store data. FastHTML makes it easy to connect to and manage this library. Plus, it uses PicoCSS for styling. Do you know what CSS is?

**Julie**: It’s what makes the web pages look nice with colors and layouts, isn’t it?

**Jeremy**: Spot on! CSS is like the decoration of our web pages. PicoCSS is a minimalist version, which means it keeps things looking clean and simple without a lot of extra work. Now, why do you think having everything in one place, like FastHTML does, is useful?

**Julie**: Maybe because it makes building and managing websites faster and less confusing?

**Jeremy**: Exactly! FastHTML is designed to be extensible and replaceable. This means you can add or change parts of it easily using Python modules from pip. Have you ever heard of pip?

**Julie**: Yeah, I think it’s a tool to install Python packages.

**Jeremy**: That’s right! Pip is like a package manager for Python. It lets you easily add new features to your project. So, if you need something that FastHTML doesn’t include by default, you can install a new module for it. Why do you think having this flexibility is important?

**Julie**: It sounds like it makes the system adaptable, so you can keep improving it without starting from scratch.

**Jeremy**: Precisely. Flexibility is key in web development because requirements often change. FastHTML’s approach allows developers to quickly adapt and extend their projects. So, what do you think about using tools like Markdown, PicoCSS, and pip to build web pages?

**Julie**: It sounds really efficient and manageable. I like how everything works together to make things simpler.

**Jeremy**: That’s the goal! FastHTML is all about making web development more accessible and less daunting. By keeping things simple and flexible, we can focus more on creating great content and less on managing complex code. Ready to dive deeper into how all this works?

**Julie**: Absolutely! I want to learn more about how these pieces fit together.

**Jeremy**: Great! Let’s continue exploring how each component contributes to building a functional and beautiful web page with FastHTML.

### part 2

The site you’re reading right now provides background information about the key concepts and ideas behind FastHTML. The [documentation](https://docs.fastht.ml/) focuses on the code. Because FastHTML brings together many different web technologies, it’s worth investing some time to understand how it all fits together. Have a look through the five sections in the green navbar (or hamburger menu if you’re on mobile) above to deepen your understanding. As one of our preview users told us:


**Jeremy**: Julie, do you see how this site gives you information about FastHTML? It’s not just about using the tool, but also understanding the concepts behind it. Why do you think understanding these concepts is important?

**Julie**: Maybe because if you understand how things work, you can use them better and fix problems if they come up?

**Jeremy**: Exactly! When you know the concepts, you can troubleshoot, improve, and even innovate. Now, this site is structured to help you learn. Have you noticed the green navbar or hamburger menu?

**Julie**: Yeah, I see it. It has different sections to explore.

**Jeremy**: Right. This layout is designed to guide you through different parts of FastHTML. Let’s say you clicked on one of those sections. What kind of information do you expect to find?

**Julie**: Probably more detailed explanations about how to use FastHTML and how its features work.

**Jeremy**: That’s correct. Each section will dive deeper into specific areas, like how to use Markdown, manage authentication, access databases, and style your site with PicoCSS. Let’s take a moment to think about why it’s beneficial to break down information into these sections rather than putting everything on one page.

**Julie**: I guess it makes it easier to find what you’re looking for without getting overwhelmed.

**Jeremy**: Exactly! Organizing information into sections makes it more digestible and user-friendly. Have you ever tried to read a long, unorganized document and felt lost?

**Julie**: Oh yes, it’s hard to follow and I usually give up halfway.

**Jeremy**: And that’s what we want to avoid. By structuring the documentation this way, we help users find the specific information they need without getting lost. One of our preview users even mentioned how helpful this structure was. Why do you think feedback from users is valuable?

**Julie**: Because they’re the ones actually using the tool, so they know what works and what doesn’t.

**Jeremy**: Exactly. User feedback is crucial for improvement. It helps us understand what’s working well and what needs tweaking. In the context of FastHTML, this feedback loop ensures the documentation and the tool itself are as user-friendly and effective as possible. 

**Julie**: That makes sense. So, if I wanted to learn more about using FastHTML, exploring these sections would be a good start?

**Jeremy**: Absolutely. Each section will give you a comprehensive understanding of different components and how they fit together. And remember, investing time in understanding these concepts now will make you a more effective and confident web developer later. Ready to explore one of these sections?

**Julie**: Definitely! Which one should we start with?

**Jeremy**: Let’s begin with Markdown since it’s a foundational tool for creating content. We’ll explore how it works and why it’s so powerful for web development with FastHTML. Sound good?

**Julie**: Sounds great! Let’s go!

## Background

[site](https://about.fastht.ml/#sec2)

### part 1

FastHTML is a system for writing web applications in Python. It is designed to be simple, powerful, and flexible. It is also designed to be easy to learn and use. The project is inspired by technologies such as React JSX, Hotwire, Astro, FastAPI, and Phoenix LiveView. FastHTML is small and simple—at the time of writing, it’s under 1000 lines of code. That’s because it’s built on top of powerful and flexible foundations: Python, Starlette, Uvicorn, and HTMX. If you’re a FastAPI user, much of FastHTML will look very familar; FastAPI was a major inspiration.

**Jeremy**: Julie, have you ever worked with Python before?

**Julie**: A little bit, yes. I've done some simple scripts and played around with it.

### part 2

FastHTML was originally started by Jeremy Howard at Answer.AI for a number of reasons:

- Over 25 years of web development, Jeremy realized that web programming could be easier and more powerful. He was particularly concerned that recent trends had moved away from the power of the web’s foundations, resulting in a fractured ecosystem of over-complex frameworks and tools
- He saw that two small but ingenious developments had made the web’s foundations more powerful and more accessible: **ASGI** and **HTMX**. But the tools available for using them were still too complex, and the barriers to entry were still too high

**Jeremy**: Julie, do you know why FastHTML was originally started?

**Julie**: I’m not sure. Why was it started?

**Jeremy**: Well, I started FastHTML at Answer.AI because I realized that web programming could be made easier and more powerful. Over my 25 years in web development, I noticed a trend towards more complex frameworks and tools. Why do you think complexity can be a problem in web development?

**Julie**: Maybe because it makes it harder for people to learn and use the tools?

**Jeremy**: Exactly. Complexity can create high barriers to entry, making it difficult for beginners to get started and for experienced developers to be efficient. I wanted to address this by creating something simpler. Two small but ingenious developments had already made the web’s foundations more powerful and accessible: ASGI and HTMX. Have you heard of these?

**Julie**: We talked a bit about HTMX, but I’m not familiar with ASGI.

**Jeremy**: That’s okay. ASGI stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface. It’s a specification that allows for asynchronous web servers and applications in Python, making them more efficient and capable of handling many requests at once. Why do you think handling many requests efficiently is important for a web application?

**Julie**: So that the website can work smoothly even if lots of people are using it at the same time?

**Jeremy**: Exactly. Efficiently handling requests ensures a better user experience, especially for popular sites. HTMX, on the other hand, allows us to create dynamic web pages using HTML instead of relying heavily on JavaScript. This keeps things simpler and more manageable. Despite these powerful tools, I noticed that the available tools to use ASGI and HTMX were still too complex. What do you think we aimed to achieve with FastHTML in light of this?

**Julie**: You probably wanted to make it easier to use these tools so more people could take advantage of them.

**Jeremy**: Precisely. FastHTML was designed to lower the barriers to entry, making it easier for both beginners and experienced developers to create powerful web applications. It simplifies the use of ASGI and HTMX, integrating them in a way that is accessible and user-friendly. Why do you think simplifying powerful tools is beneficial for the development community?

**Julie**: It makes it more inclusive, so more people can contribute and create better things.

**Jeremy**: That’s a great point. Simplifying powerful tools democratizes web development, allowing more people to innovate and improve the web. FastHTML builds on the strengths of ASGI and HTMX while removing unnecessary complexity. Ready to see how we can use these tools to create a simple but powerful web application?

**Julie**: Yes, I’m excited to learn how it all comes together!

**Jeremy**: Fantastic! Let's start with a basic example. We’ll see how FastHTML uses Python to create dynamic and efficient web applications, leveraging the power of ASGI and HTMX. We'll break it down step-by-step to understand how each part works. Ready?

**Julie**: Ready! Let's dive in!

### Two Types of Tools: A Socratic Dialogue

**Julie**: Jeremy, are there different kinds of tools for making websites?

**Jeremy**: Yes, Julie, there are two main types of tools: "domain expert tools" and "serious programmer tools." 

**Julie**: What's the difference between them?

**Jeremy**: Domain expert tools, like Streamlit, Gradio, and WordPress, are great for beginners. They make it really easy to get started, but they can become a problem if your project becomes big and complicated. On the other hand, serious programmer tools, like React and Django, are designed for building large, complex projects but can be tough to learn and use.

**Julie**: Why is it a problem if my project gets big?

**Jeremy**: If you start with a domain expert tool and your project becomes very successful, you might find it can't handle the complexity. Then you might have to start over with a more powerful tool, which can mean learning a new programming language or a new way of doing things.

**Julie**: That sounds frustrating. Why do people use domain expert tools then?

**Jeremy**: People use them because they're easy and fast for getting started. They have high-level abstractions, which means they simplify things by hiding a lot of the complex details. This makes them great for trying out new ideas quickly.

**Julie**: And what about the serious programmer tools?

**Jeremy**: Serious programmer tools can manage big, complex applications, but they add a lot of extra complexity right from the start. This can make learning them difficult and slow down development.

**Julie**: So, if I use a serious programmer tool, it might be harder to get started?

**Jeremy**: Exactly. The extra complexity can make it hard to learn and maintain, even though it might handle bigger projects better in the long run.

**Julie**: How does FastHTML fit into this?

**Jeremy**: FastHTML tries to combine the best of both worlds. It makes it easy to start small and simple, like the domain expert tools, but it also scales up easily without needing to switch tools, just like the serious programmer tools. This way, you don't have to compromise.

### HTMX and FastHTML: A Socratic Dialogue

**Julie**: Jeremy, how do most web applications work today?

**Jeremy**: Most web applications use a combination of JSON and HTML data sent over HTTP. JavaScript, with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue, combines this data for display in the browser. This is called an "API-based" approach.

**Julie**: What's different about the approach used by HTMX and FastHTML?

**Jeremy**: HTMX uses a "hypermedia-based" approach, which simplifies things by just returning HTML. FastHTML is designed to create hypermedia applications, which reduces the complexity of client-server programming.

**Julie**: How does this approach work with FastHTML?

**Jeremy**: When you request a page, the server responds with a standard HTML page. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
  <head><title>FastHTML Page</title></head>
  <body>
    <p id="greet" hx-get="/change">Hello World!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This page can be generated using FastHTML like this:

```python
@rt('/')
def get():
    return Div(P('Hello World!'), hx_get="/change")
```

**Julie**: What happens when I click on the link in this example?

**Jeremy**: Clicking on the link sends a request to the server, which responds with an "HTML partial," or a snippet of HTML. This snippet replaces part of the existing page:

```html
<p>Nice to be here!</p>
```

Here's the FastHTML code for this handler:

```python
@rt('/change')
def get():
    return P('Nice to be here!')
```

**Julie**: How does HTMX make this approach easier?

**Jeremy**: HTMX removes constraints by allowing any event on any DOM element to trigger any HTTP method on any path, and place the response anywhere in the DOM. This flexibility makes building dynamic web applications much simpler.

**Julie**: Should I learn more about this hypermedia-based approach?

**Jeremy**: Absolutely! If you haven't built a hypermedia-based application before, I recommend reading the "Hypermedia Systems" book. It explains how to use HTMX to build such applications, and the techniques you learn will be directly applicable to FastHTML.

**Julie**: So, FastHTML and HTMX make web development more straightforward and flexible?

**Jeremy**: Exactly! By using HTML directly and simplifying interactions between the server and the browser, FastHTML and HTMX make it easier to build modern, interactive web applications without the complexity of traditional API-based methods.

**Julie**: How do I run my FastHTML application with Uvicorn?

**Jeremy**: Running your FastHTML application with Uvicorn is simple. You just add the `serve()` function at the end of your `main.py` file. When you do this, it starts a web server on your computer, and you'll see a message with a link to your running application.

**Julie**: What does the `serve()` function do?

**Jeremy**: The `serve()` function calls Uvicorn to run the server. Here's the line of code that makes it happen:

```python
uvicorn.run(f"{fname}:{app}", host=host, port=port, reload=reload)
```

This line sets up the server to listen on a specific host and port and to reload the app automatically if you make changes.

**Julie**: How do I deploy my application for others to use?

**Jeremy**: When you're ready to share your app, you can deploy it using a service provider like Railway or Vercel. Our one-click deployment option runs `python main.py` for you, and the provider connects Uvicorn's port to a public IP address.

**Julie**: Can I run my application on my own server?

**Jeremy**: Yes, you can! You can use a VPS (Virtual Private Server) to run your application. You can set the `PORT` environment variable to `80` to make it accessible directly, or use a frontend server like nginx or caddy to forward requests to Uvicorn's port.

**Julie**: So, Uvicorn makes it easy to run and share FastHTML applications?

**Jeremy**: Sure, Julie! FastHTML uses a data structure called FT, which stands for "FastTag." FT objects are created using functions named after HTML tags, like `Div`, `P`, and `Img`.

**Julie**: How do these functions work?

**Jeremy**: These functions take two types of arguments: positional and keyword arguments.

- **Positional Arguments**: These are a list of children, which can be text strings (becoming text nodes), FT child components, or other Python objects that are converted to strings.

- **Keyword Arguments**: These are a dictionary of attributes used to set the properties of the HTML tag.

- **HTMX Attributes**: Keyword arguments that start with `hx_` are used for HTMX-specific attributes.

**Julie**: Can you give an example of how to create an FT object?

**Jeremy**: Certainly! Here’s an example of creating a simple HTML structure:

```python
Div(
    P("Hello World!", style="color:blue;"),
    Img(src="image.png", alt="An image")
)
```

This code creates a `Div` element with a `P` tag inside it and an `Img` tag, styling the paragraph and adding an image.

**Julie**: Are there any special functions in FastHTML?

**Jeremy**: Yes, some functions have special syntax. For example, `File` takes a single filename argument and creates a DOM subtree representing the file's contents.

**Julie**: Jeremy, you mentioned that frameworks like React use a single language like JavaScript or TypeScript to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. How does that work? How can one language weave these three together to build a web app’s structure, look, and interactivity?

**Jeremy**: Great question, Julie! Let’s dive into how these frameworks use JavaScript or TypeScript to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making front-end development easier and more efficient.

### JavaScript and TypeScript in Front-End Frameworks

1. **Unified Language**: Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue use JavaScript or TypeScript as the main language, which simplifies the development process by reducing context switching between languages. This means developers can write everything using a consistent syntax and paradigm.

2. **Component-Based Architecture**: These frameworks encourage building applications with reusable components. Each component encapsulates its own HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic, allowing you to build complex interfaces from small, manageable pieces.

3. **Integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**:

   - **HTML (via JSX and Templates)**: In React, JSX is used to write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript. JSX allows you to create HTML elements within JavaScript code, which the framework then compiles into actual DOM elements. In Angular and Vue, templates provide a similar function, where HTML is used with special directives or bindings to dynamically generate content.

   - **CSS (via Stylesheets and CSS-in-JS)**: CSS is integrated using traditional stylesheets or modern techniques like CSS-in-JS. Frameworks allow you to apply styles directly within components, ensuring that styles are scoped to specific elements, preventing conflicts and making maintenance easier.

   - **JavaScript Logic**: JavaScript (or TypeScript) handles all the logic, including state management, event handling, and API interactions. This centralization of logic within a single language enables easier debugging and development.

### How They Work Together

- **JSX in React**: JSX allows you to write HTML elements within JavaScript. It looks like HTML, but it’s actually JavaScript code. When compiled, JSX transforms into `React.createElement` calls that generate the virtual DOM, which React uses to efficiently update the real DOM.

  ```jsx
  function MyComponent() {
    return <div className="my-class">Hello, World!</div>;
  }
  ```

- **Templates in Angular and Vue**: Angular and Vue use templating systems that combine HTML with directives or bindings. These templates allow you to bind data and react to changes, making the UI dynamic.

  ```vue
  <template>
    <div>{{ message }}</div>
  </template>

  <script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        message: 'Hello, World!',
      };
    },
  };
  </script>
  ```

- **Component State and Logic**: JavaScript or TypeScript within components manages the state and logic. State management libraries like Redux can be used alongside these frameworks to manage application-wide state.

### Making Development Easier

- **Efficiency**: By using a single language, you streamline the development process, reducing the overhead of switching between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Reusability**: Components allow for reusable, self-contained code that can be easily shared across applications.
- **Scalability**: These frameworks provide tools and patterns that help manage the complexity of large applications, making them easier to maintain and extend.

**Julie**: So, using a single language through frameworks, we can write cleaner, more efficient code that integrates everything we need for front-end development?

**Jeremy**: Exactly! These frameworks abstract the complexities of integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing developers to focus on building features and functionality efficiently and effectively.

  - A protocol used for transferring data between clients (browsers) and servers over the web. It defines how requests and responses should be formatted and transmitted.
  - **HTTP Methods**: Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data).

### How Back-End Languages Handle HTTP

1. **JavaScript (Node.js):**
   - Node.js handles HTTP requests and responses using built-in modules like `http` and frameworks like Express that simplify creating and handling routes.

2. **Python:**
   - Frameworks like Flask, Django, and FastAPI provide tools to define endpoints, handle requests, and generate responses, all using HTTP.

### Wrapping Around HTTP/2

- **HTTP/2**: 
  - A major revision of HTTP, offering features like multiplexing, header compression, and server push, which improve performance over HTTP/1.1.
  - Back-end languages and frameworks can support HTTP/2 by configuring the server (e.g., using Nginx or Apache) to enable it or using libraries that handle HTTP/2 connections directly.

**Julie**: So, back-end development involves setting up servers, creating APIs, managing databases, and implementing business logic. Languages like JavaScript and Python help bridge front-end and back-end by enabling seamless integration and communication. Is HTTP/2 just an improved version of HTTP?

**Jeremy**: Exactly! HTTP/2 enhances performance by allowing multiple requests to be sent in parallel, reducing latency and improving the overall efficiency of data transfer between the client and server. By supporting HTTP/2, you can significantly improve the speed and responsiveness of your web applications.

**Julie**: Jeremy, you mentioned creating APIs in back-end development. Why do we need to create APIs, and what are they for?

**Jeremy**: Great question, Julie! APIs are a crucial part of modern web development, and they serve several important purposes. Let's explore what APIs are and why they're needed.

### What is an API?

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**:
  - An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
  - In web development, an API typically refers to a set of endpoints exposed by a server that clients can use to interact with server-side data and functionality.

### Why Do We Need APIs?

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - APIs allow the front-end and back-end to be developed independently. The front-end can focus on the user interface, while the back-end handles data processing and business logic.
   - This separation makes it easier to maintain and scale each part of the application.

2. **Data Access**:
   - APIs provide a standardized way for clients to access and manipulate server-side data. They enable front-end applications, mobile apps, or third-party services to interact with the server's resources.
   - This is especially useful for applications that need to fetch or update data frequently.

3. **Reusability and Modularity**:
   - APIs allow different applications or services to reuse the same functionality. For example, a payment processing API can be used by multiple e-commerce platforms.
   - This modularity reduces duplication of code and effort.

4. **Interoperability**:
   - APIs enable different systems to work together, regardless of their underlying technology or architecture. They provide a way for applications written in different languages to communicate and exchange data.

5. **Scalability**:
   - By providing a clear interface for data and functionality, APIs make it easier to scale applications. New features can be added to the back-end without affecting the front-end, and vice versa.

6. **Security**:
   - APIs allow developers to control access to data and functionality, implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized clients can perform certain actions.

### Types of APIs in Web Development

1. **RESTful APIs**:
   - REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
   - RESTful APIs are stateless and rely on URL paths to access resources.

2. **GraphQL APIs**:
   - GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.
   - It provides more flexibility compared to REST, enabling clients to specify the structure of the response.

3. **SOAP APIs**:
   - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.
   - It uses XML for message format and is known for its robustness and security features.

**Julie**: So, APIs are essential for connecting different parts of an application and enabling communication between them. They make development more modular, scalable, and secure?

**Jeremy**: Exactly! APIs are the backbone of modern web applications, providing a standardized way for different software components to interact and share data efficiently. They allow developers to build flexible, maintainable, and interoperable systems.

---

**Julie**: Jeremy, is creating an API a necessary part of back-end development? Can developers just use JavaScript, React, and Node.js to handle everything without an API, or even FastHTML with Python for both front-end and back-end?

**Jeremy**: Great question, Julie! Let's explore why APIs are important and when they might not be strictly necessary.

### The Role of APIs in Back-End Development

1. **Standardized Communication**:
   - APIs provide a standardized way for different parts of an application to communicate. They define clear interfaces for data exchange, making it easier to manage complex systems.
   - While you can write custom code to handle requests and responses directly, using APIs provides a more organized and scalable approach.

2. **Decoupling Front-End and Back-End**:
   - APIs decouple the front-end and back-end, allowing them to be developed, maintained, and scaled independently. This separation is beneficial for teams working on different parts of an application or when using different technologies for each side.

3. **Reusability and Interoperability**:
   - APIs allow multiple clients (web, mobile, third-party services) to interact with the same back-end logic. This reusability is a key advantage of APIs.
   - APIs also enable interoperability between systems, allowing different applications to communicate even if they are written in different languages.

4. **Security and Access Control**:
   - APIs provide a controlled interface for accessing back-end resources, allowing developers to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### When You Might Not Need a Separate API

1. **Small, Monolithic Applications**:
   - For small applications or those where the front-end and back-end are tightly coupled, you might not need a separate API. In such cases, direct communication between front-end and back-end components can be simpler.

2. **Single Language and Framework**:
   - If you're using a single language and framework (e.g., JavaScript with Node.js), you can handle requests and responses directly within the same codebase. This can be efficient for small teams or projects.

3. **FastHTML with Python**:
   - FastHTML allows developers to use Python for both front-end and back-end logic. In some cases, you might handle everything within a single application without exposing a separate API.

### Benefits of Using APIs Even When Not Strictly Necessary

- **Scalability**: APIs provide a clear path for scaling applications, allowing you to add new features or clients without major refactoring.
- **Maintainability**: APIs help organize code and define clear boundaries between components, making it easier to manage and update applications over time.
- **Flexibility**: Even if not needed initially, having an API allows you to integrate additional clients or services in the future.

**Julie**: So, while APIs aren't always strictly necessary, they offer many advantages in terms of organization, scalability, and flexibility. Is that right?

**Jeremy**: Exactly! While you can build applications without a separate API, especially when using the same language across the stack, APIs provide a structured approach that benefits most projects as they grow in complexity and scale.

**Jeremy**: Excellent questions, Julie! Let’s clarify what API endpoints are and how Uvicorn and Starlette relate to API frameworks.

### What are API Endpoints?

- **API Endpoints**: 
  - An API endpoint is a specific URL where an API can be accessed by clients. It represents a unique location where a particular resource or service is available.
  - Endpoints are defined by a path and an HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Each endpoint corresponds to a function that performs a specific action or returns a specific piece of data.

  **Example**: 
  - An endpoint might be `GET /api/users` to retrieve a list of users, or `POST /api/users` to create a new user.

### Do You Need a Separate API Framework?
