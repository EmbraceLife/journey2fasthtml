Jeremy: Alright Julie, let's explore these next two comments. They're explaining something really cool about how FastHTML handles our todo items.

Julie: I'm ready to learn!

Jeremy: Great! First, do you remember what a Form is in HTML?

Julie: It's where we put things like input fields, right?

Jeremy: Exactly! Now, normally in HTML, we can only put certain types of things inside a Form, like input fields and buttons. But FastHTML lets us do something special. We can put our Todo objects directly inside the Form.

Julie: But how does that work? Isn't a Todo object something we made up for our app?

Jeremy: That's a great observation, Julie! You're right, a Todo object is something specific to our application. The browser doesn't naturally know how to display it. That's where the `__ft__` method comes in.

Julie: What's `__ft__`? It looks kind of funny with those underscores.

Jeremy: Good eye! In Python, names with double underscores like that are special. The `__ft__` method is a special method we define in our Todo class. It tells FastHTML how to convert our Todo object into something the browser can understand and display.

Julie: Oh, so it's like a translator for our Todos?

Jeremy: That's a fantastic analogy, Julie! It's exactly like a translator. When FastHTML needs to display a Todo, it calls this `__ft__` method, which "translates" the Todo into HTML that the browser can show.

Julie: So we don't have to write out all the HTML for each Todo ourselves?

Jeremy: Exactly! FastHTML does it for us automatically. Whenever it sees a Todo object, it knows to call this `__ft__` method to get the HTML version.

Julie: That's so cool! But when does FastHTML know it needs to do this?

Jeremy: Another great question! FastHTML is smart about this. It only converts the Todo objects into HTML when it actually needs to send them to the browser. This is what we call "lazy evaluation" - it doesn't do the work until it's necessary.

Julie: Oh, like how I don't start my homework until I need to hand it in?

Jeremy: [laughs] Well, maybe not quite like that! But it is similar in that FastHTML waits until the last moment to do the conversion. This can make our application more efficient, especially if we're dealing with a lot of Todos.

Julie: I see! So FastHTML is doing a lot of work for us behind the scenes.

Jeremy: You've got it, Julie! This is one of the powerful features of FastHTML. By defining this `__ft__` method and letting FastHTML handle the conversion, we can work with our Todo objects in a way that feels natural to us as Python programmers. At the same time, we're creating web pages that browsers can understand and display.

Julie: This is amazing, Jeremy! It's like FastHTML is bridging the gap between how we think about our data and how the browser needs to see it.

Jeremy: That's an incredibly insightful way to put it, Julie! You're really grasping the core concepts here. FastHTML is indeed bridging that gap, making it easier for us to build web applications without having to constantly switch between different ways of thinking about our data. You're asking great questions and making excellent connections. Keep up this level of curiosity and analysis!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Jeremy: Excellent question, Julie! You're really digging into the details of how FastHTML works.

Julie: Thanks! I'm curious about how we actually use this `__ft__` thing.

Jeremy: That's great! To answer your question: yes, developers typically do write their own `__ft__` function for their custom objects, like our Todo items.

Julie: Oh, so we have to write it ourselves? Where do we put it?

Jeremy: We usually define the `__ft__` function right inside our Todo class. It might look something like this:

```python
class Todo:
    def __init__(self, title, done=False):
        self.title = title
        self.done = done

    def __ft__(self):
        checkbox = Input(type="checkbox", checked=self.done)
        return Li(checkbox, self.title)
```

Julie: Oh, I see! So it's part of the Todo class itself?

Jeremy: Exactly right! By defining `__ft__` as part of the Todo class, we're telling FastHTML how to convert any Todo object into HTML.

Julie: But why do we need to do this? Couldn't FastHTML just figure it out?

Jeremy: That's a great question! While FastHTML is pretty smart, it doesn't know the specific details of how we want our Todos to look on the web page. By writing our own `__ft__` function, we have complete control over how our Todos are displayed.

Julie: Oh, I get it! So we could make the Todos look different just by changing this function?

Jeremy: You've got it! We could easily change how our Todos are displayed. For example, we could add a delete button, change the styling, or display additional information about the Todo.

Julie: That's really flexible! But when does FastHTML actually use this function?

Jeremy: FastHTML calls this function whenever it needs to convert a Todo object into HTML. This usually happens when we're building our web page and we include Todo objects in our page structure.

Julie: So it's like FastHTML is asking our Todo, "Hey, how should I show you on the web page?"

Jeremy: That's a fantastic way to think about it, Julie! It's exactly like that. FastHTML is asking each Todo object to describe itself in HTML terms.

Julie: This is so cool, Jeremy! It's like we're teaching our Todos how to introduce themselves to the web browser.

Jeremy: I love that analogy, Julie! You're absolutely right. By defining `__ft__`, we're giving our Todo objects the ability to introduce themselves in a way that web browsers understand. You're showing a great understanding of how objects in our code relate to what users see in their browsers. Keep thinking about these relationships - it's a key part of web development!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## 4.o v6 part 3

### Socratic Dialogue: Jeremy Howard and Julie on `__ft__` Method and `FT` Objects in fasthtml

**Jeremy**: Let’s continue by diving deeper into the next two comments. They talk about including `todo` objects directly in the `Form` and converting them to `FT` objects using the `__ft__` method. Can you read those comments again for me?

**Julie**: Sure! The comments say:

```python
# We can include the todo objects directly as children of the `Form`, because the `Todo` class has `__ft__` defined.
# This is automatically called by FastHTML to convert the `Todo` objects into `FT` objects when needed.
```

**Jeremy**: Great. Let’s break these down. First, let’s talk about the `__ft__` method in the `Todo` class. In Python, the `__ft__` method is a special method that we define to tell FastHTML how to convert a `Todo` object into an `FT` (FastHTML) object. This makes it possible to include `Todo` objects directly in our `Form`. Do you know what a special method in Python is?

**Julie**: I think so. Special methods usually start and end with double underscores, like `__init__`. They are used for specific purposes in Python.

**Jeremy**: Exactly! Special methods define how objects of a class behave with respect to specific operations. For instance, `__init__` initializes a new object, and `__str__` defines how the object is represented as a string. The `__ft__` method is specific to FastHTML and defines how to convert an object to an `FT` object, which is a format FastHTML uses to represent HTML elements. Here’s a simple example of what the `__ft__` method might look like in the `Todo` class:

```python
class Todo:
    def __init__(self, title, priority):
        self.title = title
        self.priority = priority
    
    def __ft__(self):
        # Converts the Todo object into an FT object for HTML representation
        return Div(f"{self.title} - Priority: {self.priority}")
```

In this example, the `__ft__` method returns a `Div` element that includes the title and priority of the todo. This way, when we include `Todo` objects in the `Form`, FastHTML knows how to convert them into HTML elements.

**Julie**: So, `__ft__` tells FastHTML how to turn a `Todo` into an HTML element. That’s why we can use `Todo` objects directly in the `Form`.

**Jeremy**: Exactly! This automatic conversion simplifies our code and keeps it clean. Instead of manually converting each `Todo` to an HTML element, we define the conversion once in the `Todo` class, and FastHTML handles the rest. Now, let’s talk about `FT` objects. `FT` stands for FastHTML Template. These objects represent HTML elements in a way that FastHTML can understand and render. Do you remember how we used `Div` and other elements in our code?

**Julie**: Yes, we used `Div`, `H1`, `A`, and others to create different parts of the page.

**Jeremy**: Exactly. All these elements are examples of `FT` objects. They are part of FastHTML's way of creating and managing HTML content. By defining `__ft__` in our `Todo` class, we make sure that each `Todo` object can be easily converted into these `FT` objects. This way, when we do something like this:

```python
frm = Form(*todos(order_by='priority'), id='todo-list',
